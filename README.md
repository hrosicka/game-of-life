Welcome! This repository contains several interactive C implementations of **Conway’s Game of Life**. Study, experiment, and enjoy the fascinating emergence of complex behavior from simple rules.

## 🧬 What is the Game of Life?

[Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) is a cellular automaton played on a grid of cells, each of which is either alive or dead. At each time step ("generation"), cells update state according to their neighbors:

- **Survival:** A live cell with 2 or 3 live neighbors survives.
- **Death:** A live cell with fewer than 2 or more than 3 live neighbors dies.
- **Birth:** A dead cell with exactly 3 live neighbors becomes alive.

No players, just rules—and surprisingly rich behavior.

## 🧩 Implemented Patterns & Features

This repository provides ready-to-run simulations for several classic Game of Life patterns:

- **Blinker:** A simple period-2 oscillator.
- **Toad:** Another period-2 oscillator.
- **Glider:** The famous moving pattern.
- **Lightweight Spaceship (LWSS):** A mobile pattern that travels diagonally.
- **Gosper Glider Gun:** Emits endless gliders—demonstrating infinite growth.
- **Pulsar:** A period-3 oscillator.
- **Beacon:** One of the best-known and most frequently occurring simple patterns. Beacon alternates between only two different shapes.
- **Custom Patterns:** Easily experiment with your own initial states by editing the source.

All simulations feature animated terminal output (for Windows), wrap-around grid edges, and are well-commented for learning and modification.

## 🚀 How to Run

> **Note:** All programs are written in C for Windows (require `windows.h`). To compile and run, use GCC:

### Blinker Oscillator
```bash
gcc game-of-life-blinker.c -o game-of-life-blinker
./game-of-life-blinker
```

### Toad Oscillator
```bash
gcc game-of-life-toad.c -o game-of-life-toad
./game-of-life-toad
```

### Glider
```bash
gcc game-of-life-glider.c -o game-of-life-glider
./game-of-life-glider
```

### Lightweight Spaceship (LWSS)
```bash
gcc game-of-life-lwss.c -o game-of-life-lwss
./game-of-life-lwss
```

### Gosper Glider Gun
```bash
gcc game-of-life-gun.c -o game-of-life-gun -lm
./game-of-life-gun
```

### Pulsar Oscillator
```bash
gcc game-of-life-pulsar.c -o game-of-life-pulsar
./game-of-life-pulsar
```

## Beacon
```bash
 gcc game-of-life-beacon.c -o game-of-life-beacon
./game-of-life-beacon
```
